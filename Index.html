      <h4>I have always been <sup>tall</sup>, decidedly <sup>tall</sup>. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a <sub>young age</sub>, I would ask countless questions, from How heavy is the Earthüåé? To Where does rainüåßÔ∏è come from? My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student‚Äç. Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played   <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/20Q_red_%28Radica%29_front.jpg" target="_blank">20Q</a> (the electronic version of Twenty Questions). Somehow, a little <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/spherical?s=t" target="_blank">spherical</a> device guessed what I was thinking. The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/20Q_red_%28Radica%29_front.jpg" target="_blank">20Q</a>. This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life.

      <h4>I became determined to discover how <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/20Q_red_%28Radica%29_front.jpg" target="_blank">20Q</a> guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically, artificial neural networkssystems which learn and improve themselves. This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first <a href="https://prod.wp.cdn.aws.wfu.edu/sites/22/2013/08/computercamp.jpg" target="_blank">computer programming class</a> available to me. I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, and work over <a href="https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-IDE" target="_blank">Cloud-based IDEs</a>. I prized the freedom and the possibilities.</h4>

      <h4>After my introduction to <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/20Q_red_%28Radica%29_front.jpg" target="_blank">20Q</a>, I began to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions" target="_blank">Twenty Questions</a> (the traditional parlor game) and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/mediocre" target="_blank"> mediocre</a>. However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, I became more effective. I discovered the secrets to success: practice and perseverance.</h4>
